Heal your brain by reading. Every hour of assaulting your brain with dopamine response is an hour that needs to be combatted with brain healing exercises. Reading, walking, meditating, exercising. Using social media. The more pervasive and invasive dopamine stimulus is, that harder it will be to avoid and combat. Our brains do not evolve along with our technology, they are still the same brains designed for hunting and reaching for food. There will likely be a period where we are so overloaded with stimulus that we effectively shut down. Which is interesting because productivity of workers is even higher than ever. But that's mainly due to technology increasing.  This is also why we see record levels of anxiety and depression. People do not get the same rewards as they used to from long term goals being achieved, so they feel less fulfilled and achieve less goals. Modern distractions are different because there is an urgency. Missing out on an online conversation means you lose out on impressions, and thus lose views and potential gains.
